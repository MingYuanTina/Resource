	-- | 3 |
	-- | 1 |
	-- | 4 |
	-- | 5 |
	-- | 6 |

# SOLUTION
###### NOTE: nested select to handle null case ######
select (select num from number group by num having count(*) = 1 order by num desc limit 1) as num

# select num 
# from (select num, count(num) as c from number group by num) as temp
# where temp.c = 1 
# order by num desc
# limit 1
